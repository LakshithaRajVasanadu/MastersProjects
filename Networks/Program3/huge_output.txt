In the near future, Earth is no longer able to sustain humanity. Crops are routinely ravaged by blight,[5] dust storms scour the land, and humankind has regressed to an agrarian society. Cooper, a former NASA test pilot and engineer-turned-farmer lives with his family: his father-in-law, Donald; his son, Tom; and his 10-year-old daughter, Murphy — better known as "Murph" — who believes that their house is haunted by a ghost that is trying to communicate with her. Cooper challenges Murph to prove the ghost's existence through scientific inquiry. He later discovers the "ghost" is an unknown form of intelligence sending them coded messages by means of gravitational waves, altering the dust on the floor in a binary pattern that directs them to the coordinates of a secret NASA installation led by Professor Brand, formerly one of Cooper's professors.

At NASA's site, Professor Brand reveals to Cooper that a wormhole has been discovered in the solar system orbiting Saturn, and that humanity's only chance for survival is to traverse the wormhole to colonize new worlds in another galaxy. NASA scientists believe that extra-dimensional beings are communicating with them and have created the wormhole for humanity's use. Cooper is recruited to pilot Endurance, an experimental spacecraft, to follow the Lazarus Mission, a series of manned capsules sent through the wormhole to survey a dozen potential planets' long-term habitability. The 12 scientist-astronauts were to land on their assigned planets and communicate back to Earth regarding the planets' potentiality to harbor life. Once their viability is confirmed, humanity would follow aboard the NASA facility, which has been constructed to serve as an enormous space station. The resulting data from the Lazarus Mission has given NASA three potentially habitable planets: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, named after the astronauts who carried out the surveys.

Cooper's decision to join the Endurance crew as the team's pilot breaks Murph's heart, and the two part on bad terms. He joins Professor Brand's daughter, Amelia; physicist Romilly; geographer Doyle; and two multi-purpose artificially intelligent (A.I.) robots — designated CASE and TARS — on a two-year spaceflight to the wormhole before crossing over into the new galaxy. While traversing the wormhole, Amelia encounters an extra-dimensional presence that she believes has created the wormhole to save humanity.

Once through, Endurance follows the signal left by Miller's expedition, but they quickly encounter a problem: the candidate planet is in close proximity to Gargantua, a nearby rotating black hole. Due to its gravitational pull, time on the planet is much slower than on Earth. They discover that the planet is inhospitable as giant tidal waves race across its surface. Doyle is killed by a wave as the crew attempts to retrieve Miller's data recording instrument, and their departure is delayed by an hour. Upon boarding the Endurance, Cooper and Amelia discovers that 23 years have passed for Romilly.

Back on Earth, Murph is now an adult and has joined NASA where she attempts to solve a physics problem that has troubled Professor Brand for years: how the gigantic space station, far too heavy to be launched into orbit with conventional rockets, could be lifted into space. When Professor Brand's health deteriorates, he admits that he had already solved the necessary equation decades earlier, but realized that he needed data from a singularity behind a black hole to complete it. He theorized that measuring the effects of warped time and gravity surrounding a singularity may provide a clue to solving the problem, thus saving humanity. However, with that data impossible to obtain, Professor Brand came to the conclusion that there is no hope that humanity can escape Earth, opting instead to put his faith in a "population bomb," a mass repopulation project using fertilized embryos to start humankind over, a solution which sacrifices Earth's population.

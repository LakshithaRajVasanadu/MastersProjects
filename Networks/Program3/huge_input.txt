In the near future, Earth is no longer able to sustain humanity. Crops are routinely ravaged by blight,[5] dust storms scour the land, and humankind has regressed to an agrarian society. Cooper, a former NASA test pilot and engineer-turned-farmer lives with his family: his father-in-law, Donald; his son, Tom; and his 10-year-old daughter, Murphy — better known as "Murph" — who believes that their house is haunted by a ghost that is trying to communicate with her. Cooper challenges Murph to prove the ghost's existence through scientific inquiry. He later discovers the "ghost" is an unknown form of intelligence sending them coded messages by means of gravitational waves, altering the dust on the floor in a binary pattern that directs them to the coordinates of a secret NASA installation led by Professor Brand, formerly one of Cooper's professors.

At NASA's site, Professor Brand reveals to Cooper that a wormhole has been discovered in the solar system orbiting Saturn, and that humanity's only chance for survival is to traverse the wormhole to colonize new worlds in another galaxy. NASA scientists believe that extra-dimensional beings are communicating with them and have created the wormhole for humanity's use. Cooper is recruited to pilot Endurance, an experimental spacecraft, to follow the Lazarus Mission, a series of manned capsules sent through the wormhole to survey a dozen potential planets' long-term habitability. The 12 scientist-astronauts were to land on their assigned planets and communicate back to Earth regarding the planets' potentiality to harbor life. Once their viability is confirmed, humanity would follow aboard the NASA facility, which has been constructed to serve as an enormous space station. The resulting data from the Lazarus Mission has given NASA three potentially habitable planets: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, named after the astronauts who carried out the surveys.

Cooper's decision to join the Endurance crew as the team's pilot breaks Murph's heart, and the two part on bad terms. He joins Professor Brand's daughter, Amelia; physicist Romilly; geographer Doyle; and two multi-purpose artificially intelligent (A.I.) robots — designated CASE and TARS — on a two-year spaceflight to the wormhole before crossing over into the new galaxy. While traversing the wormhole, Amelia encounters an extra-dimensional presence that she believes has created the wormhole to save humanity.

Once through, Endurance follows the signal left by Miller's expedition, but they quickly encounter a problem: the candidate planet is in close proximity to Gargantua, a nearby rotating black hole. Due to its gravitational pull, time on the planet is much slower than on Earth. They discover that the planet is inhospitable as giant tidal waves race across its surface. Doyle is killed by a wave as the crew attempts to retrieve Miller's data recording instrument, and their departure is delayed by an hour. Upon boarding the Endurance, Cooper and Amelia discovers that 23 years have passed for Romilly.

Back on Earth, Murph is now an adult and has joined NASA where she attempts to solve a physics problem that has troubled Professor Brand for years: how the gigantic space station, far too heavy to be launched into orbit with conventional rockets, could be lifted into space. When Professor Brand's health deteriorates, he admits that he had already solved the necessary equation decades earlier, but realized that he needed data from a singularity behind a black hole to complete it. He theorized that measuring the effects of warped time and gravity surrounding a singularity may provide a clue to solving the problem, thus saving humanity. However, with that data impossible to obtain, Professor Brand came to the conclusion that there is no hope that humanity can escape Earth, opting instead to put his faith in a "population bomb," a mass repopulation project using fertilized embryos to start humankind over, a solution which sacrifices Earth's population.

With the lengthy mission to retrieve Miller's data having consumed valuable resources, Endurance is forced to choose between following the two other planets, Mann or Edmunds. Cooper and Amelia clash, with Cooper accusing her of being compromised by her emotional attachment to Edmunds; Amelia counter-accuses Cooper of being compromised by his desire to see his family again as Endurance can only reach one planet and still return to Earth. They ultimately decide to set their path to Mann. The crew finds and revive Mann on an icy, ammonia-saturated planet, where he had been stranded with his now-incapacitated multi-purpose artificially intelligent (A.I.) robot, KIPP. However, Mann has forged data about the viability of his planet so that the Endurance would come and rescue him from his isolation. When Cooper decides to return to Earth, Mann attempts to kill Cooper, cracking his helmet and leaving him to die. As Romilly is killed by a booby-trapped KIPP, Mann flees to Endurance with the shuttle, intending to take the population bomb to Edmunds's planet instead. Amelia rescues Cooper, and the two give chase but are unable to prevent Mann from docking improperly with Endurance, which kills Mann when the airlock depressurizes. With TARS's help, Cooper manages to get a damaged Endurance back under control.

With little fuel remaining, Cooper and Amelia formulate a plan to pilot Endurance to Gargantua's ergosphere, jettison TARS into the event horizon once his shuttle runs out of fuel to shed mass, and to have TARS send data regarding the singularity within the black hole, which they hope to relay back to Earth. Once the robot transmits the data back to them, they would slingshot themselves on a course to Edmunds's planet. Traveling so close to Gargantua causes around 68 years to pass by on earth in the duration of their slingshot attempt. Cooper then surprisingly releases his shuttle into Gargantua as well to reduce the Endurance's weight, allowing Amelia to escape the gravitational pull. When passing the event horizon, Cooper ejects before his craft is destroyed, and comes to a halt in an extra-dimensional space where time is not linear. He realizes that the extra-dimensional beings are in fact a future form of humanity who have evolved to the point of transcending three-dimensional time and space, and have come back in time to create the wormhole to ensure humanity's survival. Now equipped with TARS's data on the singularity, Cooper is able to communicate with Murph across the dimensional barrier from inside a tesseract through gravitational waves, turning himself into the "ghost" from her childhood. With this information, Murph is able to complete Brand's equation, allowing Earth's population to be evacuated.

Soon after, the tesseract closes, and Cooper is mysteriously transported back through the wormhole and rescued by a NASA ship. He awakens aboard the NASA station orbiting Saturn, where the doctor attending him informs Cooper that he is one hundred and twenty-four years old. Tearfully, expecting a negative response, he asks his doctor if Murph is still alive. He is surprised to learn that she has been in a cryogenic sleep for two years, but that she has been brought out of it and is excited to see him. Cooper is shown around the new world and is reunited with an elderly Murph, who tells him that she has children and grandchildren of her own, and he should not be there to see her die. She convinces him to go to Amelia, seeing as he is in love with her, who has located the remains of Edmunds's expedition (and buried his body) and a planet that can sustain life. After saying goodbye, he and the newly repaired TARS steal a NASA ship to begin the journey to find Amelia.[6]n the near future, Earth is no longer able to sustain humanity.

He is surprised to learn that she has been in a cryogenic sleep for two years, but that she has been brought out of it and is excited to see him. Cooper is shown around the new world and is reunited with an elderly Murph, who tells him that she has children and grandchildren of her own, and he should not be there to see her die. She convinces him to go to Amelia, seeing as he is in love with her, who has located the remains of Edmunds's expedition (and buried his body) and a planet that can sustain life. After saying goodbye, he and the newly repaired TARS steal a NASA ship to begin the journey to find Amelia.[6]n the near future, Earth is no longer able to sustain humanity. Crops are routinely ravaged by blight,[5] dust storms scour the land, and humankind has regressed to an agrarian society. Cooper, a former NASA test pilot and engineer-turned-farmer lives with his family: his father-in-law, Donald; his son, Tom; and his 10-year-old daughter, Murphy — better known as "Murph" — who believes that their house is haunted by a ghost that is trying to communicate with her. Cooper challenges Murph to prove the ghost's existence through scientific inquiry. He later discovers the "ghost" is an unknown form of intelligence sending them coded messages by means of gravitational waves, altering the dust on the floor in a binary pattern that directs them to the coordinates of a secret NASA installation led by Professor Brand, formerly one of Cooper's professors.

At NASA's site, Professor Brand reveals to Cooper that a wormhole has been discovered in the solar system orbiting Saturn, and that humanity's only chance for survival is to traverse the wormhole to colonize new worlds in another galaxy. NASA scientists believe that extra-dimensional beings are communicating with them and have created the wormhole for humanity's use. Cooper is recruited to pilot Endurance, an experimental spacecraft, to follow the Lazarus Mission, a series of manned capsules sent through the wormhole to survey a dozen potential planets' long-term habitability. The 12 scientist-astronauts were to land on their assigned planets and communicate back to Earth regarding the planets' potentiality to harbor life. Once their viability is confirmed, humanity would follow aboard the NASA facility, which has been constructed to serve as an enormous space station. The resulting data from the Lazarus Mission has given NASA three potentially habitable planets: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, named after the astronauts who carried out the surveys.

Cooper's decision to join the Endurance crew as the team's pilot breaks Murph's heart, and the two part on bad terms. He joins Professor Brand's daughter, Amelia; physicist Romilly; geographer Doyle; and two multi-purpose artificially intelligent (A.I.) robots — designated CASE and TARS — on a two-year spaceflight to the wormhole before crossing over into the new galaxy. While traversing the wormhole, Amelia encounters an extra-dimensional presence that she believes has created the wormhole to save humanity.

Once through, Endurance follows the signal left by Miller's expedition, but they quickly encounter a problem: the candidate planet is in close proximity to Gargantua, a nearby rotating black hole. Due to its gravitational pull, time on the planet is much slower than on Earth. They discover that the planet is inhospitable as giant tidal waves race across its surface. Doyle is killed by a wave as the crew attempts to retrieve Miller's data recording instrument, and their departure is delayed by an hour. Upon boarding the Endurance, Cooper and Amelia discovers that 23 years have passed for Romilly.

Back on Earth, Murph is now an adult and has joined NASA where she attempts to solve a physics problem that has troubled Professor Brand for years: how the gigantic space station, far too heavy to be launched into orbit with conventional rockets, could be lifted into space. When Professor Brand's health deteriorates, he admits that he had already solved the necessary equation decades earlier, but realized that he needed data from a singularity behind a black hole to complete it. He theorized that measuring the effects of warped time and gravity surrounding a singularity may provide a clue to solving the problem, thus saving humanity. However, with that data impossible to obtain, Professor Brand came to the conclusion that there is no hope that humanity can escape Earth, opting instead to put his faith in a "population bomb," a mass repopulation project using fertilized embryos to start humankind over, a solution which sacrifices Earth's population.

With the lengthy mission to retrieve Miller's data having consumed valuable resources, Endurance is forced to choose between following the two other planets, Mann or Edmunds. Cooper and Amelia clash, with Cooper accusing her of being compromised by her emotional attachment to Edmunds; Amelia counter-accuses Cooper of being compromised by his desire to see his family again as Endurance can only reach one planet and still return to Earth. They ultimately decide to set their path to Mann. The crew finds and revive Mann on an icy, ammonia-saturated planet, where he had been stranded with his now-incapacitated multi-purpose artificially intelligent (A.I.) robot, KIPP. However, Mann has forged data about the viability of his planet so that the Endurance would come and rescue him from his isolation. When Cooper decides to return to Earth, Mann attempts to kill Cooper, cracking his helmet and leaving him to die. As Romilly is killed by a booby-trapped KIPP, Mann flees to Endurance with the shuttle, intending to take the population bomb to Edmunds's planet instead. Amelia rescues Cooper, and the two give chase but are unable to prevent Mann from docking improperly with Endurance, which kills Mann when the airlock depressurizes. With TARS's help, Cooper manages to get a damaged Endurance back under control.

With little fuel remaining, Cooper and Amelia formulate a plan to pilot Endurance to Gargantua's ergosphere, jettison TARS into the event horizon once his shuttle runs out of fuel to shed mass, and to have TARS send data regarding the singularity within the black hole, which they hope to relay back to Earth. Once the robot transmits the data back to them, they would slingshot themselves on a course to Edmunds's planet. Traveling so close to Gargantua causes around 68 years to pass by on earth in the duration of their slingshot attempt. Cooper then surprisingly releases his shuttle into Gargantua as well to reduce the Endurance's weight, allowing Amelia to escape the gravitational pull. When passing the event horizon, Cooper ejects before his craft is destroyed, and comes to a halt in an extra-dimensional space where time is not linear. He realizes that the extra-dimensional beings are in fact a future form of humanity who have evolved to the point of transcending three-dimensional time and space, and have come back in time to create the wormhole to ensure humanity's survival. Now equipped with TARS's data on the singularity, Cooper is able to communicate with Murph across the dimensional barrier from inside a tesseract through gravitational waves, turning himself into the "ghost" from her childhood. With this information, Murph is able to complete Brand's equation, allowing Earth's population to be evacuated.

Soon after, the tesseract closes, and Cooper is mysteriously transported back through the wormhole and rescued by a NASA ship. He awakens aboard the NASA station orbiting Saturn, where the doctor attending him informs Cooper that he is one hundred and twenty-four years old. Tearfully, expecting a negative response, he asks his doctor if Murph is still alive.

He realizes that the extra-dimensional beings are in fact a future form of humanity who have evolved to the point of transcending three-dimensional time and space, and have come back in time to create the wormhole to ensure humanity's survival. Now equipped with TARS's data on the singularity, Cooper is able to communicate with Murph across the dimensional barrier from inside a tesseract through gravitational waves, turning himself into the "ghost" from her childhood. With this information, Murph is able to complete Brand's equation, allowing Earth's population to be evacuated.

Soon after, the tesseract closes, and Cooper is mysteriously transported back through the wormhole and rescued by a NASA ship. He awakens aboard the NASA station orbiting Saturn, where the doctor attending him informs Cooper that he is one hundred and twenty-four years old. Tearfully, expecting a negative response, he asks his doctor if Murph is still alive. He is surprised to learn that she has been in a cryogenic sleep for two years, but that she has been brought out of it and is excited to see him. Cooper is shown around the new world and is reunited with an elderly Murph, who tells him that she has children and grandchildren of her own, and he should not be there to see her die. She convinces him to go to Amelia, seeing as he is in love with her, who has located the remains of Edmunds's expedition (and buried his body) and a planet that can sustain life. After saying goodbye, he and the newly repaired TARS steal a NASA ship to begin the journey to find Amelia.[6]
